# --- 
# What this Dockerfile does:
# 1. Uses a multi-stage build to optimize the final image size.
# 2. In the build stage, it uses a Maven image to compile the Java application
#    and package it into a JAR file.
# 3. In the runtime stage, it uses a lightweight JDK image to run the application.
# 4. The final image contains only the necessary runtime components and the
#    compiled JAR file, making it smaller and more efficient.
